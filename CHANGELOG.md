## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- Missing `src-tauri/capabilities/` permissions were blocking core Tauri APIs at runtime
- Wrong notification permission identifiers (`allow-notify`, `allow-check-permissions`)
- `tauri.conf.json` used an inline `infoPlist` object where a file path was expected; replaced with a proper `src-tauri/Info.plist`
- Invalid `plugins.shell` config caused a startup panic; the shell plugin was unused dead code and has been removed entirely
- Missing `thiserror` and `tracing-subscriber` (`env-filter`) dependencies
- A local `Result<T>` alias was shadowing `std::result::Result` in the `Serialize` impl for `AppError`
- Main window did not reliably appear on launch; added explicit activation policy and `show()`/`set_focus()` in the setup hook
- CI previously excluded the Tauri app crate from checks, hiding all of the above

### Added

- Full English/German UI translation (`useLangStore`, language toggle)
- README onboarding sections: how it runs, screenshot, in practice, uninstall/cleanup
